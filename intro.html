        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <div class="mg-1">
            <p>MControl is a MVC light framework. </p>
            <p>MC.Controller class is provided for implementing controller behavior:
                MVC Controllers are responsible for controlling the flow of the application execution.
            </p>
            <p> Provided features are :
                <ul>
                    <li>interpolated javascript model expression in HTML : {&#8203;{ js expression }&#8203;}
                    </li>
                    <li>two-way binding beetween input element and model property: m-bind:value="property"</li>
                    <li>event handling binded to controller method: m-on:event=" this.method($event) "</li>
                    <li>collection of dom elements through 'm-ref' modifier labeling labeling"</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>No other library </h3>
            <p>MC don't embed third party libraries, feel free to use it in your app code. This
                choice avoid you conflicts when you embed MC with others open source components
                and keep MC small.
            </p>

                then programming must be the process of putting them in.”

            </blockquote>
    

            <h3>No Virtual DOM</h3>
            <p>MC don't use virtual DOM, My opinion is that we don't need (and don't like) to use an other
                language to explain the HTML I already know. That's why decorating HTML with new attributes
                ignored by browsers seemed to me less invasive and let your HTML knowledge valid and reusable.

            <h3>KISS principle</h3>
            <p>Keep it simple and small is my KISS principle (And i hope not too much stupid).
                MC is actualy 700 lines of code. I tried and will try to do my best to keep it small
                for a reduced load time, to keep a low memory footprint and have good performance.

            <h2>MC Concepts</h2>
            <p>Controllers are javascript ES6 classes</p>
            <p>Modifiers</p>
            <p>For MC modifiers are new attributes added to HTML language.
                <ul>
                    <li>All modifiers start with 'm-' prefix to avoid clash name with html standard attributes<br>
                        ex: m-control , m-bind, m-class, ...
                    </li>
                    <li>Some modifiers are extended with identifiers to define parameters of the modifier<br>
                        ex: mb-bind:value to indicate the node property to binded
                    </li>
                    <li>Some modifiers have a value to describe its behavior<br>
                        ex: m-style:text-align="µ.alignement"
                    </li>
                </ul>
